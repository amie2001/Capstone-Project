# 🚀 Capstone Project: Application Deployment (Production-Ready)

This project demonstrates the end-to-end deployment of a **React application** into a production-ready state using Docker, Jenkins, AWS, and open-source monitoring tools. Everything — from containerization to CI/CD automation and deployment — is handled using CLI tools and scripts.

> ✅ Deployed to **port 80** (HTTP) on an AWS EC2 instance.  
> 🎯 Docker images pushed to **Docker Hub** (`dev` - public, `prod` - private).  
> 🔁 Auto-trigger builds from **GitHub branches (dev & master)** via **Jenkins**.  
> 📈 Live application health monitored with alerts on failure.

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### ✅ 1. Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/amie2001/Capstone-Project)]
cd Capstone-Project
```

### 🐳 2. Dockerize the React App

- **Dockerfile** created to build the React app.
- Built image using:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

📌 *Script builds and tags image as `pavi2244/react-app`*

---

### 📦 3. Docker Compose

- Used `docker-compose.yml` to spin up the app on port 80.
- Deploy script:

```bash
bash deploy.sh
```

---

### 🛳 4. Push to Docker Hub

- Created two repositories:
  - [`pavi2244/dev`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pavi2244/dev) (public)
  - `pavi2244/prod` (private)

- Images are tagged and pushed from scripts and Jenkins jobs.

---

### 🔁 5. Git & GitHub

- CLI used for all Git actions.
- `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` added.

```bash
git checkout -b dev
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin dev
```

---

### 🤖 6. Jenkins CI/CD

- Jenkins installed and configured on AWS.
- Two branches monitored:
  - **dev** → builds & pushes to `dev` Docker Hub repo.
  - **master** → pushes to `prod` repo on merge.

- Webhooks enabled for auto-trigger.
-

---

### ☁️ 7. AWS Deployment

- EC2 instance (t2.micro) on AWS used for hosting.
- Security Groups:
  - App open on port 80.
  - SSH access only from your IP.

- Application successfully deployed and accessible via public DNS.

---

### 📈 8. Monitoring Setup

- Open-source monitoring tool used (prometheus and grafana).
- Configured to:
  - Continuously ping the app endpoint.
  - Send alerts when the app goes down.



---

## 🌐 Final Result

Application running successfully on an AWS-hosted server on **port 80** with CI/CD, monitoring, and private/public Docker image handling.

## 🧹 To Clean Up

```bash
docker-compose down
terraform destroy     # if using IAC for provisioning (optional)
```

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Real-world CI/CD implementation using **branch-based pipelines**
- Working with **private/public Docker registries**
- Setting up **production-ready environment** on AWS
- Using **monitoring** tools to keep app health in check
